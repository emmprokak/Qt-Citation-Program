# Qt Citation Program 
## Copyright (C) 2021 Prokakis Emmanouil

This Citation Program, written in C++ and powered by Qt, aims to help the user format his/her citations in a more automated way. The program formats the data given by the user to a complete citation, ready to be pasted into school/university projects and academic papers!

The program allows users to cite papers, books and in-book chapters in both the Harvard and APA citation standards. All the user has to do is enter data in the textfields of the GUI, and the program will format the citation in a proper manner.

### For Windows users:

-Download the zip folder from releases.

-Run "Qt Citation Program.exe" from inside the folder.
### Window defender will NOT allow you to run the exe since it's an unsigned executable you got from the internet.
### After the "don't run" window appears, you will be able to unblock the application by going to the properties of "Qt Citation Program.exe" and checking the unblock checkbox. Don't forget to press apply before closing the properties window.


Please remember that I am a self-taught programmer, and that I do this as a hobby because: a) It's fun and b) I want to give back to the Free and Open Source Software community.

If there is anything in the code that could be classified as a bad practice, please don't hesitate to point it out, since it's going to make the software better and help me improve in the future.

I'm always open to suggestions and very grateful for useful feedback.
